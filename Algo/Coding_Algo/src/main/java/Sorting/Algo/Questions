1) Heap sort is not stable ?
   Answer : In this max is moving to last element. Here order is getting change

2) Quick sort

3) Tree :

1) Height of complete binary tree of N  nodes.

    h = height
    N = nodes
    d = degree (Maximumu of number of nodes) For binary tree it is 2. For treniary it is 3.

    h = log base d (N)

    For banary tree degree is 2

  height of binary tree with N node= log base 2  ( N)



2) Height of a complete terniary (k) tree of N nodes = log to base k (N)


3) Height of binary tree with N nodes = log to base(d) N ----Range till  N

4) Number of nodes in bainry tree of height h : h ranges to 2 raise to power h

  If tree is skewed in one direction: h


5)Number of nodes in a complete binary tree : 2 raise to power h
