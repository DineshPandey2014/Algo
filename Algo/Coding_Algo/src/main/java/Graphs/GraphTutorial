1) Number of vertices in the graph of n nodes. If there is no self loop and no multi edge.
 Undirected Graph :- ((n)(n-1)/2)
 Directed Graph:- (n)(n-1)

 Example : Number of edges for Undirected graph having 10 nodes : (10) * (10 -1)/2 = 45 (half of directed graph)
           Number of edges for Undirected graph having 10 nodes : (10) * (10 -1) = 90

 2)Graph is represented as Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List

 3)Path : A sequence of vertices. Where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. <A,B,F,H>

 4) Simple Path: A path in which no vertices is repeated and thus no edges repeated.

 5) Simple Cycle graph : Start and end at same vertex. No repeation other then start and end.

 6) Acyclic graph: A graph with no cycle. A tree a acyclic graph.
