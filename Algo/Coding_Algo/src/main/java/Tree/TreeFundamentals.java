     * No of edges
     *
     *  1. Tree with N nodes have n-1 edge.
     *  2. There is edge for each node except root.
     *
     *  Depth of Tree:
     *
     *  1. Depth of X node = length of path from root to X node OR No of edges in path from root to X.
     *  2. Depth of root nose is 0.
     *
     *  Height Of Teee:
     *
     *  1. Height of X node : No of edges in longest path from X to leaf node.
     *  2. Height of Tree : Height of root node.
     *
     *  Binary Tree:
     *  1) A tree in which each node can have at most 2 children.
     *
     *  Application of Tree:
     *
     *  1. Stroring naturally hierarchical data. Example file system.
     *  2. Organize data for quick Search, Insertion, Deletion.      ---> Binary search tree.
     *  3. Trie dictionary
     *  4. Networking route algorithm
