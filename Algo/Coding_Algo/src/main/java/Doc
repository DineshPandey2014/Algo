Tree:

Binary Tree

Binary Tree: Binary treee can have at most 2 childeren.
Height of binary Tree: Number of edges in the longest path from root to a leaf node.
Height of Tree => Height of root.
Height of tree with 1 node = 0;

BST (Binary Serarch Tree)
Height of BST (Binary Search Tree): h = logn (It's base 2) = 2^n;

Successor in BST :

Three Cases
1) If node X have right sub tree
      -: Successor will be minimum in that three.
2) If node X doesn't have a right subtree and right child of it's parent.
3) If node X doesn't have a right subtree and it is the left child of it's parent node.
      -: Successor will be parent of node X.
