Stack implementation

1) Used by undo mechanism in text editor.
2) Used in complier checking for matching brackets and braces.
3) Can be used to model a pile of books and plates.
4) Used to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls.
5) Can be used to to depth first search (DFS) on graph.

Complexity

Pushing : O(1)
Popping: O(1)
Peeking: O(1)
Searching: O(n)
size: O(1)

Example Brackets: Given a String made up of the following brackets () [] {} properly matched.
{} --> Valid
[{()}] ---> Valid
{] --->Invalid
