/**
 * This is your coding interview problem for today.

 This problem was asked by Uber.

 Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the
 product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

 For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
 If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

 Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

 We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As always, feel free to shoot us an email
 if there's anything we can help with.
