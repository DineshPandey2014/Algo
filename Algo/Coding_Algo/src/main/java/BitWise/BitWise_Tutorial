Negative Numbers

1. Negative Numbers  in binary is represented as Two's complement.
2. All the negative numbers start from 1 means leading number is 1.

Positives Numbers :
 1. All the positive numbers start from 0 means leading number is zero.

Let's say we represent the number in the three digits
Conversion of positive numer that is decimal number 2, 4, 5 ---> Simply represent in the form binary number
  2 --> 010
  4 --> 100
  6 --> 110
  8 --> 1000

Conversion of negative number to Binary number let's say represnt in three digits. It's equivalent to 2^3 - number
                                                let's day represent in eights digits. It's equivalent to 2^8 - number

  -2 -->  2^3 -2 => 8 -2 => 6 => 110
  -4 ---> 2^3 -4 => 8 -4 => 4 => 100


1) & ---> AND operator --> Returns true if and only of both arguments are true.

2) | ---> Or operator ---> Returns true if and only if one arguments is true.

3) ^ ---> Exclusive OR ---> Returns true if both arguments are diffetent.
          Example : 1 ^ 0 => 1
                     0 ^ 1 => 1
                     0 ^ 0 => 0
                     1 ^ 1 => 0

4) ~ ---> Bit wise complement operator---> Negate operator.

AND Operator (&)
1) System.out.println(true & true) ---> true --> If operand is boolean the result will be boolean
   System.out.println(true & false) ---> false
   System.out.println(false & true) ---> false
   System.out.println(false & false) ---> false

OR Operator (|)
2) System.out.println(true  | true) ---> true ---> if operand is boolean the result will be boolean
   System.out.println(true  | false) ---> true
   System.out.println(false | true) ---> true
   System.out.println(false | false) ---> false

Exclusive OR (^)
3) System.out.println(true  | true) ---> false --> if operand is boolean the result will be boolean
   System.out.println(false  | true) ---> true
   System.out.println(true  | false) ---> true
   System.out.println(false  | false) ---> true

AND Operator (&)
1) System.out.println(4 & 5)  If operand is number the result will be number

   Binary Representaiton of 4 is = 100
   Binary Representaiton of 5 is = 101

   System.out.println(100 & 101) => 100 => 4

OR Operator (|)
2) System.out.println(4 | 5)  If operand is number the result will be number

   Binary Representaiton of 4 is = 100
   Binary Representaiton of 5 is = 101

   System.out.println(100 | 101) => 101 => 5

Exclusive OR ^ Operator (^)
2) System.out.println(4 ^ 5)  If operand is number the result will be number
   If two bits are different then they are one other wise they are zero.

   Binary Representaiton of 4 is = 100
   Binary Representaiton of 5 is = 101

   System.out.println(100 | 101) => 001=> 1

 Right Shift Operator : Remove the digit from right. Means division by 2
 int x = 4 make right shift by 1

 int x = 4
 int y = x >> 1
         (Shift by one digit right)
       = 1 0 0 >> 1 = 1 0 (So right shift means division by 2 = 4/2 = 2 = 10)

        (Shift by two digit)
       = 1 0 0 >> 2 = 1 (So right shift means division by 2 = 4/2 = 2 and then onemore shift by one digit 2/2 = 1)



Left Shift Operator : Add the digit to right. Means multiple by 2
int x = 4 make left shift by 1
int x = 4

int y = x << 1 (Left Shift by one digit by 1) => Multiple by 2
      = 1 0 0 << 1 = 1 0 0 0 = 8 =  ( So left shift by 1 means multiple by 2)

      = 1 0 0 << 2 = 1 0 0 0 0 = 16 = ( So left shift by 2 means multiple by 4)


1) Set the bit in nth position-->: Setting the bit means if the number is 0 or 1 set it to 1
                                If it is one don't do any thing.

                                100110---> setting the bit at 4 postion is --> 101110

2) Clearing the bit means if it is 1 make it 0:  1 --->0
   If it is 0 it will remain 0 : 0 ----> 0

3) Toggling the bit means change 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

4) Get the bit get the value at that postion.
